# ASSIGNMENT-9
## Task-1 Setting up the Debugging Environment
    The projects debugg properties can be set from the 'Debugging Properties'.
    The command line arguments can be set to be used while debugging.
    The working directory from which the project will be launched.
    Hot reload option is enabled to update the changes to the code while debugging.
    The native code debugging can be enabled, to debug the managed code and native code together, which is known as mixed debugging.
    The debug windows has breakpoint, output window, immediate window, exception settings in it.

    Breakpoint:
        The breakpoint is used to pause debugger execution.
        It is set to any line of code.
        Breakpoint can be set by clicking the far left margin before the code.
    
    Output window:
        Output window displays status messages for various features in the IDE.
    
    Watch window:
        Watch window displays variables while debugging.
        Watch window and QuickWatch window displays varibles and expressions while debugging.

    Call Stack:
        The call stack shows the functions or procedure calls that are currently on the stack.
        It shows the order in which the functions are called.

    Autos Window:
        The autos window shows the variable value of the current statement.

    Local Window:
        The local window shows the values of the variable value in local scope.

        
## Task-2 Basic Debbuging Technique
    The breakpoints are set to code by using the F9 key or clicking the left gutter to add a breakpoint.
    The F5 key or Debug option is used to launch the application with debugger attached to it.
    The step into, step over, step out and continue buttons are used to navigate through the code while debugging.
    The Locals window is used to check the variable values of local scope.

    The watch window is used to add expressions or variables for monitoring

## Task-3 Advanced Debugging Techniques
    Exception Settings:
        The Exception settings is used to control the type of exceptions to be triggered.

    Conditional Breakpoints:
        Conditional breakpoints are used to pause the debugger execution when a certain condition is fulfiled.
        Hit counts can be also set as condition.

    Quick Watch:
        Quick watch window displays one variable value at a time. It must be closed to continue debugging.
