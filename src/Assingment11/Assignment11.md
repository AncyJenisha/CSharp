# ASSIGNMENT-11 AUTOMATED TESTING
## Task-1 Setting Up a Test Project Using Xunit
A XunitTestingAssignment is created and a class CalculatorTests is created with functions to tests the mathematical functions to be created for the calculator class.

Test Driven Developement:
    Test Driven Development is the software development process where, the requirements are converted into test cases before the software is fully developed and it is repeatedly tested while development to check its functionality.

## Task-2 Writing the Application to Be Tested.
 A Calculator application is created with the mathematical functionalities like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
 A OrderService application is created to put products for sale and buy from the list of products for sale. It has functions to place order, remove it and display the order.

## Task-3 Writing Different Types of Tests
Unit Test:
    Unit test is written to check the smallest functioning part of the program.
Data Driven Test:
    Data driven test depends on the input and output by comparing the values of the expected output and actual output.

## Task-4 Understanding and applying Testing Concepts
AAA - Arrange Act Assert
Arrange: The step to setup the code before testing. It is organising code before testing.
Act: The part where we execute the test.
Assert: The comparison between the result of the test and the expected output.

## Task-5 Using Xunits Advanced Features
Tests of different classes run parallely and the tests of same class run serially.

## Task-6 Understanding Assertions in Xunit
Assert checks if a condition passed as an argument and if the condition evaluates to true no action is executed and if it evaluates to false the program breaks, when in debug mode.

`Assert.Equal`: To compare two instances for equality.

`Assert.Throws`: Checks if the method execution throws an exception of the same type.
