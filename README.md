# ASSINGMENT-1
    For the practical excercise  a CSharp console application needs to created which has a class 'MathUtils' containing the methods like add, subtract, Multiply, Divide that performs the arithmetic operations on the integers recived from user through the main class and displays the result.

 ## MathUtils Class
        1. It has methods like add, subtract, multiply, divide to perform the arithmetic operations.
        2. It recieves the two integers as input parameters to perform the functions.
        3. The methods displays the results of the operations.
## Main Class
        1. The main class recieves two integers from user as input.
        2. The main class has GetInput method to recieve an number as a string and converts it to an integer.
        3. It displays the options for the different arithmetic operations.
        4. It recives the user's perferred aithemtic operation as option.
        5. The method for preferred arithemetic operations are called based on the option.
